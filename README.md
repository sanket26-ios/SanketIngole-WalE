U can Just Download And Run project From Xproje


#Improvement Areas
- Instead of saving image In Data format in userDefaults can download and save in Device with folder
- write Test Cases for functionality testing
- Coding can be done more function oriented so that writing test cases will be easy
- Before storing image need to check device space
- Loader should be there, So that user can understand it is in progress(As UI wont contain extra point, So not implemented)
